</p>

#### Operating Regions

| Region | Condition | Behavior |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Linear** | V_DS < (V_GS - V_th) | Id varies linearly with V_DS |
| **Saturation** | V_DS ‚â• (V_GS - V_th) | Id influenced by channel length modulation |

**Key Observation:**
- Before V_DS = V_GS - V_th ‚Üí Linear Region (ohmic behavior)
- After V_DS = V_GS - V_th ‚Üí Saturation Region (current flattens)

### Long Channel vs. Short Channel NMOS

#### **Observation 1: Id-Vgs Characteristics**

Comparing two devices with **identical W/L ratios** but different absolute dimensions:

| Device Type | W | L | Classification |
|-------------|---|---|----------------|
| Long Channel | 1.8 ¬µm | 1.2 ¬µm | L > 250 nm |
| Short Channel | 0.375 ¬µm | 0.25 ¬µm | L < 250 nm |

<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/long_vs_short_channel_comparison.png" width="450"/>
</p>

**Electrical Behavior Under Constant V_DS:**

**Long-Channel Devices:**
- Drain current (Id) exhibits ideal **quadratic dependence** on V_GS
- Classical square-law behavior: Id ‚àù (V_GS - V_th)¬≤

**Short-Channel Devices:**
- Id is quadratic at **low V_GS**
- Transitions to **linear relationship** at high V_GS
- Caused by **velocity saturation** limiting carrier velocity

  <img src="Images/id_vgs_quadratic_to_linear.png" width="450"/>
</p>

### Velocity Saturation Effects

#### Physical Mechanism

**At Low Electric Fields:**
- Carrier velocity increases linearly with electric field
- v_drift = ¬µ √ó E

**At High Electric Fields:**
- Carrier velocity saturates at maximum value (v_sat ‚âà 10‚Å∑ cm/s for Si)
- Further increase in E does not increase velocity
- Results in linear Id-Vgs relationship instead of quadratic

<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/velocity_vs_electric_field.png" width="450"/>
</p>

#### Impact on Operating Modes

**Long Channel Devices (> 250 nm):**
```
Cutoff ‚Üí Resistive ‚Üí Saturation
```

**Short Channel Devices (< 250 nm):**
```
Cutoff ‚Üí Resistive ‚Üí Velocity Saturation ‚Üí Saturation
```

An **additional velocity saturation mode** appears between resistive and saturation regions in short-channel devices.

### Peak Current Comparison

#### **Observation 2: Maximum Drain Current**

| Device | W | L | Peak Id |
|--------|---|---|---------|
| Long Channel | 1.8 ¬µm | 1.2 ¬µm | **410 ¬µA** |
| Short Channel | 0.375 ¬µm | 0.25 ¬µm | **210 ¬µA** |

<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/peak_current_comparison.png" width="450"/>
</p>

**Key Insight:**

Despite enabling faster switching and higher integration density, **short-channel devices deliver lower peak current** compared to long-channel devices.

**Reason:** Velocity saturation limits carrier velocity in short channels, preventing the current from reaching theoretical maximums based on geometry alone.

- Long-channel: Carriers accelerate freely ‚Üí Higher Id
- Short-channel: Velocity capped by saturation ‚Üí Lower Id

### CMOS Voltage Transfer Characteristics

#### MOSFET as a Switch

**OFF State (Open Switch):**
- Condition: |V_GS| < |V_th|
- Resistance: Infinite (no conduction)

**ON State (Closed Switch):**
- Condition: |V_GS| > |V_th|
- Resistance: Finite R_on

---

### CMOS Inverter Operation

#### Transistor-Level and Switch-Level View

**Circuit Configuration:**
- PMOS connected to V_DD (pull-up network)
- NMOS connected to V_SS/GND (pull-down network)
- Input (V_in) drives both gates
- Output (V_out) taken from common drain node
- Load capacitance (C_L) at output

<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/cmos_inverter_transistor_switch_view.png" width="450"/>
</p>

#### Operating States

**When V_in = V_DD (Logic HIGH):**
- NMOS: ON (acts as resistor R_n)
- PMOS: OFF (open switch)
- **Result:** V_out = 0 (Logic LOW)

**When V_in = 0 (Logic LOW):**
- PMOS: ON (acts as resistor R_p)
- NMOS: OFF (open switch)
- **Result:** V_out = V_DD (Logic HIGH)

**Design Principle:**

This complementary operation ensures:
- **Low static power** (no DC path from V_DD to GND in steady state)
- **Sharp transitions** in voltage transfer characteristics
- Foundation of all CMOS logic circuits

### Load Line Analysis

#### Step-by-Step Construction

**Step 1: Voltage Conversion**
- Convert PMOS gate-source voltage (V_GSP) into equivalent V_in
- Express all node voltages in terms of: V_in, V_DD, V_SS, V_out

<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/load_line_step1_voltage_conversion.png" width="450"/>
</p>

**Step 2 & 3: Drain-Source Mapping**
- Convert both PMOS and NMOS drain-source voltages to V_out
- NMOS: V_DS = V_out
- PMOS: V_SD = V_DD - V_out

<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/load_line_step2_step3_vds_mapping.png" width="450"/>
</p>

**Step 4: Merge Load Curves**
- Equate NMOS and PMOS I_ds characteristics
- At DC equilibrium: I_DS(NMOS) = I_DS(PMOS)
- Sweep V_in from 0 to V_DD
- Plot corresponding V_out to generate VTC curve

**Result:** The Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) shows the inverter's switching behavior from logic HIGH to LOW, revealing:
- Switching threshold (V_M)
- Noise margins (NM_L, NM_H)
- Transition region width
- Gain in transition region
